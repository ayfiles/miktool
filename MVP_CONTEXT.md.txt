# MVP CONTEXT – Textile Order Automation

## Problem
A textile B2B company captures orders manually when visiting customers.
The process is slow, error-prone, and not automated.

## Goal (MVP)
While being at the customer:
- enter order parameters in a UI
- automatically generate:
  1. Order overview PDF (customer-facing)
  2. Production sheet PDF (internal)
  3. Mockup sheet PDF (visual preview)

## Core Principle
- Single source of truth = JSON
- Simple logic
- Modular system
- No ERP, no pricing, no authentication in MVP

## User Journey
Customer meeting → fill UI → submit → JSON → automation → PDFs

## Tech Stack (MVP)
Frontend: Next.js
Backend: Node.js (Express)
Database: Supabase (products only)
Mockups: ComfyUI (fixed workflow)
PDFs: HTML + CSS → Puppeteer

## Scope Limits
- 1–3 products only
- One branding method (print)
- Front mockup only
- No user management
- No invoicing

## Folder Output
/orders/{order-id}/
- order.json
- order_overview.pdf
- production_sheet.pdf
- mockup_front.png
- mockups.pdf
